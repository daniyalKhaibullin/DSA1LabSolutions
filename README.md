# DSA1LabSolutions
The following repository serves as a container for all the previous lab submissions for Data Structures and Algorithms I lab. 
---
This repository will host the weekly Java labs. You can accept the assignments each week either through the links below or via the link that we will send on Moodle.

For any questions or concerns about the labs, please use the Issues page in this repo. At the top of the page, under the name of the repository, there is a tab called Issues. Once you click on that, you will see an option to add a New issue (green button in the right corner). Begin the title of your issue with the lab number followed by the problem and use the description box to describe the problem in more detail (e.g. ''Lab3 - Problem with..."). Please write brief, general questions that do not reveal your code or reasoning in solving the labs.

Please refrain from individually contacting the tutors via email, Moodle or alike. If you have a question, chances are high that someone else is sharing the same concern, so it would help all of us to be more efficient. Of course, we encourage you all to come to the lab sessions on Fridays where you can ask your questions in person, but in case you want to ask something in advance or if something comes up after the session, this is the way to ask.

For general questions about the course, please use the Public Discussion Forum on the Moodle course page.

Make sure you are "watching" this repository in order to receive updates. (The eye icon in the top right corner of the page)
